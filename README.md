This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Assignment Explanation:
This is assignment 1 for the subject CSE3CWA. For our first task, we were tasked with creating a home page that consisted
of the tab features that helps generate html code in the box next to it which can be copy pasted into a note pad
to make a html file which can then be opened into an actual file. 

Beyond the home page, our page was required to have a:
- a header
- a footer
- a navbar
- a light/dark mode switch
- a hamburger menu
- and 4 other pages (about, coding resources, escape room and pre-lab-questions).

The 'about' page will consist of personal details and a video demonstrating the code and how the website works. And the rest
are work in progresses.
